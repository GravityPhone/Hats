# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This setting contains a list of rules that Sweep will check for. If any of these rules are broken in a new commit, Sweep will create an pull request to fix the broken rule.
rules:
  - "All new business logic should have corresponding unit tests."
  - "Refactor large functions to be more modular."
  - "Add docstrings to all functions and file headers."
  - "examine project docs to ensure codebase aligns with concepts contained within"

# This is the branch that Sweep will develop from and make pull requests to. Most people use 'main' or 'master' but some users also use 'dev' or 'staging'.
branch: 'main'

# By default Sweep will read the logs and outputs from your existing Github Actions. To disable this, set this to false.
gha_enabled: True

# This is the description of your project. It will be used by sweep when creating PRs. You can tell Sweep what's unique about your project, what frameworks you use, or anything else you want.
#
# Example:
#
# description: sweepai/sweep is a python project. The main api endpoints are in sweepai/api.py. Write code that adheres to PEP8.
description: "The program initiates by activating its listening capability for specific keywords. Upon detecting the keyword "computer," it starts an audio recording session. The recording continues until the keyword "reply" is heard, which signals the end of the recording. Additionally, if the keyword "snapshot" is detected during the recording, the program captures an image immediately.After the recording ends, the audio file is sent to Assembly AI for transcription. The program then needs to decide how to handle this transcription based on the context of ongoing conversations. It checks if there is an existing thread that was recently interacted with (within the last 90 seconds). This check is facilitated by a variable that tracks the state change when a message is received back from the assistant.Depending on whether a recent thread exists, the program either creates a new thread for the transcription or adds the transcription to the last active thread. After establishing where the transcription should go, it initiates a stream on the chosen thread to continue the interaction. This process is designed to ensure that the program can effectively manage and continue conversations based on user inputs and the temporal context of interactions."

# This sets whether to create pull requests as drafts. If this is set to True, then all pull requests will be created as drafts and GitHub Actions will not be triggered.
draft: False
